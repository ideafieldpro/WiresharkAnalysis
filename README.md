# Wireshark Network Analysis

## Objective

The Wireshark network analysis project aimed to provide hands-on experience in capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark, a leading network protocol analyzer. The main goal was to understand various network protocols, identify anomalies, and enhance skills in packet analysis, which are critical in the field of cybersecurity.

### Skills Learned

- In-depth understanding of packet structure and network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, etc.).
- Proficiency in using Wireshark for real-time network traffic capture and analysis.
- Ability to identify and troubleshoot network issues and security vulnerabilities through packet inspection.
- Enhanced skills in recognizing malicious traffic patterns and indicators of compromise (IoCs).
- Development of analytical skills for interpreting complex data from network packets.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark: For capturing and analyzing live network traffic.
- TCPdump: For command-line packet capturing to complement Wireshark analysis.
- Network Protocol Analyzers: To evaluate and dissect various protocols utilized in real-world scenarios.

## Steps

### 1. Capture Network Traffic

- Begin by setting up Wireshark to capture traffic on the appropriate network interface. This involves selecting the correct interface and starting the capture process.


### 2. Analyze Captured Packets

- After capturing traffic, apply filters to isolate specific protocols or types of traffic (e.g., HTTP, DNS). This helps in narrowing down the focus on relevant packets.


### 3. Identify Anomalies

- Look for unusual patterns or unexpected traffic flows that could indicate potential security threats. This could include spikes in traffic volume or connections to unusual IP addresses.


### 4. Export and Report Findings

- Document the findings by exporting relevant packet captures and creating a report summarizing the analysis. This included details about identified anomalies and suggested remediation steps.


## Conclusion

By completing this project, I have strengthened my ability to utilize Wireshark effectively for network analysis, which is a vital skill in the cybersecurity domain.
