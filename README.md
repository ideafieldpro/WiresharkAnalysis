# Wireshark Network Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project was to utilize Wireshark as a powerful network protocol analyzer to capture, filter, and analyze network traffic. The goal was to enhance the understanding of how data travels through a network, recognize patterns, detect anomalies, and identify potential security threats.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using Wireshark for capturing live network traffic.
- Ability to apply filtering techniques to isolate relevant packets for analysis.
- Understanding of various network protocols and their normal behavior.
- Skills in identifying malicious traffic and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).
- Enhanced analytical skills for interpreting packet data and deriving meaningful insights.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark: A leading network protocol analyzer for capturing and inspecting packets in real-time.
- Tcpdump: A command-line packet analyzer for capturing traffic for later analysis with Wireshark.
- Network Protocols: Familiarity with protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, and DNS for comprehensive traffic analysis.

## Steps

### 1. Capture Network Traffic
Start Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface to capture traffic. Use filters to focus on specific protocols or IP addresses.

### 2. Apply Filters
Utilize display filters to narrow down packets of interest, such as filtering by protocol (e.g., http or tcp).
